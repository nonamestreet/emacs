Magit is an interface to the version control system Git,
implemented as an Emacs package.  Magit aspires to be a complete
Git porcelain.  While we cannot (yet) claim, that Magit wraps and
improves upon each and every Git command, it is complete enough to
allow even experienced Git users to perform almost all of their
daily version control tasks directly from within Emacs.  While many
fine Git clients exist, only Magit and Git itself deserve to be
called porcelains.
